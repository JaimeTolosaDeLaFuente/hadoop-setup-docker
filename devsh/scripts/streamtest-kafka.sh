# Cloudera Developer Training
# This script generates a simulated stream of Kafka messages 
# based on data from a set of files.
# Each line in the files is sent the the specified topic as a single
# message.
# 
# Parameters:
#     topic: the name of the Kafka topic to publish messages to
#     broker-list: a comma-separated list of Kafka brokers and ports
#       (e.g. host1:2181,host2:2181)
#     lines-per-second: how fast to generate messages
#     files: one or more files (e.g. datadirectory/*)
